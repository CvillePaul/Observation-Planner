# Observation Planner

The purpose of this project is to generate observing lists from targets defined in the TargetDB database.  The lists are generated for a specified observatory and specified observing session(s), and can be output in format(s) compatible with the operations software in use at that observatory.

This work originated in service of the Quadruple Eclipsing Binaries research group, led by Steven Majewski at the University of Virginia.
